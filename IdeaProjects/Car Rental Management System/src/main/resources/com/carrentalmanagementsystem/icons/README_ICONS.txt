ICON GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS

Since I am an AI coding assistant, I cannot generate image files directly. However, I have prepared the code to use the icons you described.

Please use the prompt below with an AI image generator (like Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Adobe Firefly) to create the icons, then save them into this folder.

MAIN PROMPT:
“Design a set of modern, minimalist sidebar navigation icons for a car rental desktop application.
Style should be flat UI, vector-based, outline with subtle solid accents, optimized for desktop sidebar navigation.
Use consistent stroke width, rounded corners, and a professional SaaS look.
Icons should work well at 24x24 and 32x32 px, on a dark sidebar background.
No text, no background, transparent PNG or SVG style.”
